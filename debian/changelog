makejail (0.0.5-8) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Changes by Florian Grandel <jerico.dev@gmail.com> ]
  * Makejail default configuration now in /etc/makejail/makejail.conf
    There is no conflict now with the /etc/makejail/ directory
    and it is possible for the administrator to set defaults (Closes: #495112)
  * Changed default for straceCommand/straceCommandPid to include child
    threads (strace -ff)
  * Changed default for doNotCopy for security reasons (added /proc)
  * cleanJailFirst default now correctly documented, manual page now indicates
  * that the default value for cleanJailFirst is
    0 and not 1 (Closes: #495118) (closes: #495118)
  * should now preserve POSIX attributes (closes: #310781), still
    does not preserve ext2/ext3 attributes however
  * now copies directory as a result of chdir by introducing additional
    patterns to be processed in the strace (closes: #392773)
  * now chowns copied files (closes: #495147)
  * now correctly handles strace -ff (closes: #495277)
  * fixes several lintian warnings
  * updated policy version
  * debian/rules: now builds the documentation (should not be included in
    source)

  [ Changes by Javier Fernandez-Sanguino ]
  * Use debhelper compatibility version 5
  * Check if /sbin/ldconfig.real exists (Ubuntu systems) and set
    pathToLdConfig to /sbin/ldconfig.real to avoid
    introducing bash in all jails. (LP: #263614, closes: #495116)
  * Review documentation to fix a widespread typo in makejail
    (librairies->libraries)
  * Remove ISO-8859-1 encoding in examples/sshd.py as it prevented
    it from being loaded in newer python versions due to issues
    in enconding.
  * Include the pam.d/common-* files in the example for sshd.
  * Provides a more descriptive message if the target chroot directory does
    not exist (Closes: #193087, #570607)
  * Added Alexandre Ratti's documentation on how to setup a chrooted Apache
    with makejail, credit him in debian/copyright and distribute the files
    under the examples/ directory adjusting also the apache.py file.
    (Closes: #171842)
  * Add the Homepage location to debian/control as a pseudo-header
  * Highlight in the manpage that the package is heavily patched

makejail (0.0.5-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ldd output has now changed and some libraries might not include a '=>'
    but, rather, the absolute path. Patch makejail so it handles those lines.
    This helps it detect that it needs to install /lib/ld-linux.so.2
    in the jail (Closes: #358975)
  * Use shutil.copystat instead of the inline CopyStat function in order to
    properly preserve setuid bits (Closes: #310781)
  * Use Debhelper compatibility version 4
  * Add /usr/sbin/rndc to the example makejail file for Bind (Closes: #259453)
  * Unmount /proc if we will attempt to clean the Jail first so that
    reruning makejail will not fail if /proc is mounted (Closes: #375130)
